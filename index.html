                <h4>What Is This Game?</h4>
                <p>The Wind Waker game is an action-adventure game set in the Legend of Zelda series by Nintendo. The game takes place on islands in the Great Sea, and starts off with the protagonist, Link, on Outset Island celebrating his coming of age. During the celebrations, a giant bird drops a pirate in the island's forest. Link  rescues the pirate, but shortly afterwards, his little sister, Aryll, is kidnapped by the giant bird.</p>
                <p>The pirate agrees to assist Link in getting Aryll back home. After locating her and other kidnapped girls, Link is captured and tossed out to sea. Now, Link must gain the Hero of Time's power in order to defeat the sorcerer Ganon and rescue his sister.</p>

                <h4>Why Is It A Favorite?</h4>
                <p>One of the very first games I played growing up in the mid 2000s was the Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, or, more specifically, its demo. My siblings and I got a Nintendo GameCube as a Christmas gift, and with it came the Legend of Zelda: Collectors Disc. While the collectors disc only had the 20-minute demo of The Wind Waker game, my sister and I would take turns trying to progress as far as possible in those 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>What really drew me to this game was the sea-exploration concept and having to chart out your map instead of it just being immediately available to you. That, in addition to the cartoonish artstyle and the various puzzles throughout the game, made it very interesting to me.</p>
                <p>Prior to this, we only really got to play video games when our cousins would come visit during the Thanksgiving holiday. Those were usually fighting games, which while fun, were too repetitive for me.</p>

                <h2 class="game" id="colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</h2>
                <h4>What Is This Game?</h4>
                <p>Shadow of the Colossus is an action-adventure game by Studio Japan and Team Ico that takes place in the Forbidden Land. Wander, the protagonist, travels to a shrine there via his horse, Agro, with the corpse of a young woman named Mono. </p>
                <p>At the shring, Wander encounters shadow creatures and makes a deal with an entity to revive Mono in exchange for destroying idols that line the halls. In order to destroy them, however, Wander must locate and slay the sixteen colossi spred across the Forbidden Land that represent each idol.</p>

                <h4>Why Is It A Favorite?</h4>
                <p>This game was a huge favorite of mine in the late 2000s because it was very different to the games I had played thus far. For one thing, the game was very cinematic despite not using a lot of "speech" in-game. I really liked how subtle it was in telling its story, from the sad music that played upon completing certain objectives to the gradual changes that were occurring to Wander.</p>
                <p>The landscapes throughout the game were beautiful, and you have the freedom to travel where you liked. And you could climb just about anything. The climbing mechanic was a lot of fun; I really enjoyed how it was used with both the environment and with the colossi. There is just something about being able to scale these huge structures and the colossi themselves.</p>

                <h2 class="game" id="snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>Next up is Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater by Konami. This game was my introduction to action-adventure stealth games. My father actually picked this game up mistakenly because he thought it was another game. Stealth games aren't really his thing, so he gave it to me to try out. Suffice to say, I loved it.</p>
                
                <h4>What's the Goal?</h4>
                <p>The objective of the game is to move undetected through hostile territory while completing various mission objectives.</p>

            <section name="wayward">
                <h2 class="game" id="wayward">Wayward</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>I first discovered Wayward back in 2013. Back then, it was solely a browser-based game. This one is a favorite of mine because it doesn't push you to complete any objective or storyline. You can pretty do whatever you like as provided you survive long enough to. If you die, you start over.</p>
                <p>"You awake to discover yourself no longer in the company of good men or a fine seafaring vessel. Treasure... you remember something about treasure."</p>
                
                <h4>What's the Goal?</h4>
                <p>Wayward is a challenging turn-based, top-down, wilderness survival roguelike. Explore, build, and most importantly survive in these unforgiving lands.</p>
                <p>There is a large focus on simulation, survival and openness. There are no classes; there are no levels. Progression of your character depends on individual skill and stat gains by your interactions with items or objects in the world. You are free to play and explore the game in any fashion you wish.</p>
