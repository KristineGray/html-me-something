                <h2>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>One of the very first games I played growing up was the Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker in the mid 2000s. My siblings and I got a Nintendo GameCube as a Christmas gift, and it came with the Legend of Zelda: Collectors Disc. Prior to this, we only really got to play video games when our cousins would come visit during the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
                <p>While the collectors disc only came with a 20-minute demo version of The Wind Waker game, my sister and I would take turns trying to progress as far as possible in the demo.</p>
                <p>In addition to the gameplay itself, I really enjoyed the artstyle and sea-exploration elements of the game.</p>
                <h4>What Is This Game?</h4>
                <p>The Wind Waker game is an action-adventure game set in the Legend of Zelda series by Nintendo. The game takes place on islands in the Great Sea, and starts off with the protagonist, Link, on Outset Island celebrating his coming of age. During the celebrations, a giant bird drops a pirate in the island's forest. Link  rescues the pirate, but shortly afterwards, his little sister, Aryll, is kidnapped by the giant bird.</p>
                <p>The pirate agrees to assist Link in getting Aryll back home. After locating her and other kidnapped girls, Link is captured and tossed out to sea. Now Link must gain the Hero of Time's power in order to defeat the sorcerer Ganon and rescue his sister.</p>

                <h2>Shadow of the Colossus</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>Next up is the Shadow of the Colossus game by Team Ico. This was a huge favorite of mine in the early 2010s because it was very cinematic, there was a lot of exploring varied terrain, and the climbing mechanic. There was just something about being able to scale these huge structures and the colossi themselves that made it so fun.</p>
                <h4>What's the Goal?</h4>
                <p>In this game, your goal is to locate and slay the sixteen colossi spread across the Forbidden Land in order to receive  a disembodied entity's assistance in reviving a girl.</p>

                <h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>Next up is Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater by Konami. This game was my introduction to action-adventure stealth games. My father actually picked this game up mistakenly because he thought it was another game. Stealth games aren't really his thing, so he gave it to me to try out. Suffice to say, I loved it.</p>
                
                <h4>What's the Goal?</h4>
                <p>The objective of the game is to move undetected through hostile territory while completing various mission objectives.</p>

                <h2>Wayward</h2>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>I first discovered Wayward back in 2013. Back then, it was solely a browser-based game. This one is a favorite of mine because it doesn't push you to complete any objective or storyline. You can pretty do whatever you like as provided you survive long enough to. If you die, you start over.</p>
                <p>"You awake to discover yourself no longer in the company of good men or a fine seafaring vessel. Treasure... you remember something about treasure."</p>
                
                <h4>What's the Goal?</h4>
                <p>Wayward is a challenging turn-based, top-down, wilderness survival roguelike. Explore, build, and most importantly survive in these unforgiving lands.</p>
                <p>There is a large focus on simulation, survival and openness. There are no classes; there are no levels. Progression of your character depends on individual skill and stat gains by your interactions with items or objects in the world. You are free to play and explore the game in any fashion you wish.</p>
